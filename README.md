## Prerequisites and basic information

- This application is tested in windows 10/11
- This repo does not provide an executable -> you have to compile your own (I used Visual Studio)
- I don't guarantee that every corner case has been taken into account. The project is part of my learning process for C++ and SFML
- All dependencies are included in this repo, so it is almost plug and play :)

`git clone <https://github.com/tp-codings/SFML_TicTacToe.git`>
